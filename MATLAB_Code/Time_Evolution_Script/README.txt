This folder contains the MATLAB 2015a code that runs a time evolution simulation from P3 connectivity conditions,
with the goal of reaching a connectivity pattern like the observed P7 connectivity.

It also contains the output when the code is run with the parameters in the script, with the quantile analysis turned on.

The comments within the code guide the user about where to change the simulation parameters (i.e. probability of synapse removal and
the exponential dependence of synapse addition on the number of synapses that already exist between a climbing fiber and Purkinje cell)
within the code. They also indicate which blocks of code can be uncommented in order to run additional analyses on the simulation.
